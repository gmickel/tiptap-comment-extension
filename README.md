## How to use

Copy the [comment.ts](src/components/extension/comment.ts) and [CommentComponent.vue](src/components/extension/CommentComponent.vue) file in your extensions folder. You might have to change the component and extension depending on whether you're using TypeScript and Vue3 or not. Enough of English, let's talk code.

I jest of course, I don't think you need documentation for this. Just take look at [Tiptap.vue](src/components/Tiptap.vue) for an example implementation and come up with your own implementation of your own(or just copy paste pretending this is some solution you found on StackOverflow). If there's any question, I'll be at the [Bar](https://github.com/sereneinserenade/tiptap-comment-extension/issues)(reference to [Burn Butcher Burn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSxBVHqA-RU) from Withcer Season 2).
